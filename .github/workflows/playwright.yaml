          **Playwright failure test results**: <https://github.com/$REPOSITORY/actions/runs/$RUN_ID>

          It looks like some of the Playwright tests failed. 

          Debugging:

          - [Artifact with the Playwright report]($REPORT_ARTIFACT_URL). You can unzip it and inspect it with <https://trace.playwright.dev/>.
          - If you made changes to the frontend UI without updating snapshots, this might be the cause. 
          You can update all snapshots locally by running pnpm test:e2e:update-snapshots. You will need Docker, in order to update the Linux-based snapshots.
