# `@svg-use/core`

## Quick start

First, install the loader:

```shell
pnpm install @svg-use/webpack @svg-use/react

In the future, we might use [import attributes]() for this job, when TypeScript
allows type definitions based on them
([refer to this tracking issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/46135)).
